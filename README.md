# Scytale Backend demo

Scytale Backend server handles uploading and fetching pull requests.

## Features

- Add a new pull request.
- Fetch pull requests with customizing filtering.

## Instructions:

- "git clone" the repo.
- connect to your own mongo db database.
- "npm start" in dir.

## Side notes:

- The method I used to fetch all labels and send them to the user is not the most efficient way, but consider the limit of the 2 routes instruction and the size and use of the app it was a more elegant way.- "git clone" the repo.
